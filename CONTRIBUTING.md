# Contributing to CheckMVP

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CheckMVP! ðŸŽ‰

We built this tool to help founders, and we're excited that you want to help make it even better. Here's how you can contribute.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-idea`)
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests (`make test`)
6. Commit (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push (`git push -u origin feature/amazing-idea`)
8. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env.development

# The .env.development file will be automatically copied to .env during setup
# You may want to adjust some values in .env.development to match your local environment

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Run redis
make redis-start

# Run development server
make dev

# Run tests
make test
```

> **Note**: The `.env.development` file will be used as your local configuration. Make sure to update any necessary values like `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc. to match your local setup. Never commit your `.env` or `.env.development` files to version control.

## Testing Production Build Locally

To test the production build in your local environment:

```bash
# 1. Copy environment file for production
cp .env.example .env.production

# 2. Build the production Docker image
make prod-docker-build

# 3. Start the application
make prod-docker-start

# 4. Apply database migrations
make prod-docker-db-migrate

# 5. Open in browser
# Visit localhost:3000 (or your custom port defined in .env.production)

# 6. View application logs (optional)
make prod-docker-logs

# 7. Stop the application when done
make prod-docker-stop
```

> **Note**: Make sure to update necessary values in `.env.production` such as `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc. The `.env.production` file will be automatically copied to `.env` during the build process.

## Guidelines

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new features
- Follow the existing code style
- Describe your changes in the PR description

### Found a Bug?

1. Check if it's already reported in [Issues](https://github.com/gruz0/checkmvp/issues)
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Feature Ideas?

We love new ideas! Before coding:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. Tag it with `enhancement`
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers
