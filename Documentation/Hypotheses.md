Below is a simple outline of what your _key UI screens_ might look like for the Lean Validation Toolkit MVP. You can use these descriptions to create a few lo-fi or mid-fi mockups and showcase them on your landing page. This helps potential users visualize what’s “behind the curtain” and builds trust.

---

## 1. **Dashboard / Home Screen**

- **Purpose**: Give users a quick overview of their current hypotheses, experiments, and next steps.

**Wireframe Concept**:

```

+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  DASHBOARD                                            |
|                                                       |
|  [My Hypotheses]    [My Experiments]     [Resources]  |
|                                                       |
|   1) Hypothesis: "Indie Devs want X" [Status: Active] |
|      - Next Step: "Launch Landing Page Test"          |
|   2) Hypothesis: "Remote Collab Tool" [Status: Draft] |
|      - Next Step: "Refine Problem Statement"          |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Add New Hypothesis"                         |
|                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Key Elements**:
  - A quick list of the user’s existing hypotheses, each with a _status_ or _next step_.
  - A button for “Add New Hypothesis.”

---

## 2. **Hypothesis Creation / Edit Screen**

- **Purpose**: Let the user define or refine their hypothesis using a clear form.

**Wireframe Concept**:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lean Validation Toolkit (logo)   [User Avatar/Menu]  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  CREATE / EDIT HYPOTHESIS                             |
|                                                       |
|  [Audience]  e.g. "Solo devs building B2C SaaS..."     |
|  [Problem]   e.g. "They struggle with quick validation"|
|  [Solution]  e.g. "A fast experiment platform..."      |
|  [Benefit]   e.g. "Build correct features, less waste."|
|                                                       |
|  [Region dropdown] e.g. Worldwide, Europe, etc.        |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Get AI Feedback" (optional)                  |
|  Button: "Save Hypothesis"                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Optional**: A side panel or modal that shows _LLM suggestions_ once the user clicks “Get AI Feedback,” displaying short bullet points to refine clarity or specificity.

---

## 3. **Experiment Templates Screen**

- **Purpose**: Display experiment options relevant to B2C SaaS (e.g., landing page test, fake door test, quick survey).

**Wireframe Concept**:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lean Validation Toolkit (logo)   [User Avatar/Menu]  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  SELECT AN EXPERIMENT TEMPLATE                        |
|                                                       |
|  1) Landing Page Smoke Test [View Details]            |
|       "Publish a simple landing page, measure signups"|
|  2) Fake Door / Feature Teaser [View Details]         |
|       "Add a 'Coming Soon' button to gauge interest"  |
|  3) Short Survey / Interview [View Details]           |
|       "Ask target users for direct feedback"          |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Use Template" (ties it to your hypothesis)  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **View Details** could open a popup or new screen showing _why_ you’d do this test, _what data_ you’ll collect, and _how to measure success_.

---

## 4. **Experiment Setup / Edit Screen**

- **Purpose**: Guide the user through customizing the chosen template.

**Wireframe Concept**:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lean Validation Toolkit (logo)   [User Avatar/Menu]  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  SET UP YOUR EXPERIMENT: "Landing Page Smoke Test"    |
|                                                       |
|  Title: [ "Landing Page MVP" ]                        |
|  Objective: [ "Measure email sign-up conversion" ]    |
|  Success Metric: [ "10% sign-up rate" ]               |
|  Additional Notes: [ "Will run FB ads for 3 days" ]   |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Generate Landing Page Copy with AI"         |
|   -> [Optional LLM generated text in a modal or side] |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Save Experiment"                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Optional**: “Generate Landing Page Copy with AI” uses your LLM integration to propose a headline, subheadline, and CTA based on the user’s hypothesis.

---

## 5. **Results Input & Analysis Screen**

- **Purpose**: Once the user finishes an experiment (landing page goes live, survey completes), they manually enter or import basic metrics.

**Wireframe Concept**:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lean Validation Toolkit (logo)   [User Avatar/Menu]  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  EXPERIMENT RESULTS: Landing Page Smoke Test          |
|                                                       |
|  # of page visitors: [ 300    ]                       |
|  # of sign-ups:      [ 25     ]                       |
|  Additional notes:   [ People liked the CTA, but      |
|                       wanted more product details. ]  |
|                                                       |
|  [Calculate Conversion Button or Automatic Calculation|
|    => 25 / 300 = ~8.3%                                |
|                                                       |
|  LLM Insights (optional): "8.3% is typical for a pre-  |
|   launch B2C SaaS. Potential next steps: refine copy..."|
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Mark Experiment Complete"                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Optional**: A small widget that calculates conversion rate or other metrics.
- **Optional**: LLM-based interpretation: “This is low/average/high based on typical sign-up rates for pre-launch B2C SaaS.”

---

## 6. **Next Steps / Recommendations Screen**

- **Purpose**: Provide final suggestions after data is in (Pivot, proceed, or refine).

**Wireframe Concept**:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lean Validation Toolkit (logo)   [User Avatar/Menu]  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  NEXT STEPS / RECOMMENDATIONS                         |
|                                                       |
|  Based on your 8.3% sign-up rate...                   |
|                                                       |
|  1) Refine your audience or add a more compelling CTA.|
|  2) Consider a quick follow-up survey to those who    |
|     didn't sign up (if contact info is available).    |
|  3) If you see interest, proceed to building an alpha |
|     version or another experiment.                    |
|                                                       |
|  Button: "Plan Another Experiment"                    |
|  Button: "Revise Hypothesis"                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Reinforces the _Lean Startup_ loop: after collecting data, either pivot, iterate, or move forward with more experiments.

## 7. **Experiments List Screen**

- **Purpose**: Display a list of experiments, each with a status and next steps.

**Wireframe Concept**:

```

## 7. **How to Showcase These on Your Landing Page**

1. **Carousel or Gallery of Mockups**

   - Display 3–5 images representing _each key screen_ (Hypothesis Entry, Experiment Selection, etc.).
   - Add short captions: “Easily capture your hypothesis,” “Pick from proven experiment templates,” “Track real data and see next-step recommendations.”

2. **Short Descriptions**

   - Under each screenshot, add a line:
     - **Hypothesis Wizard**: “Quickly refine your problem, audience, solution, and benefit.”
     - **Experiment Dashboard**: “Manage multiple tests at once.”
     - **LLM Feedback**: “Get AI-generated tips to improve your messaging.”

3. **CTA / Sign-Up**
   - After the mockups, remind them that these are _working prototypes coming soon_, and if they sign up, they get _early access_.

---

## 8. **Why This Builds Trust**

1. **Visual Clarity**
   - People can see the actual flow: it’s not just marketing buzzwords.
2. **Demonstrates Progress**
   - Even if you haven’t built all these screens, mockups show _intent_ and _direction_.
3. **Shows a Plan**
   - Potential users realize you’re not just thinking about “some idea” but actually have a step-by-step user journey in mind.

---

### Final Tip: Keep It Simple

- For an MVP, 4–5 well-structured screens are enough to convey the entire _build-measure-learn_ process.
- When you display them on your landing page, keep the text short and the images prominent—people will skim.
- If you want more advanced design, you can use a free or low-cost design tool (Figma, Sketch, or even Canva) to polish it.

By providing a visual sneak peek, your landing page will look far less generic and more like an _in-progress_ platform with tangible value—encouraging visitors to trust you and join the waitlist.
