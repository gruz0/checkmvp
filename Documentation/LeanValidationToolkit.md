# Lean Validation Toolkit

## 1. Overview & Goals

### 1.1. Product Name & Vision

- **Working Name**: CheckMVP 2.0 (or “Lean Validation Toolkit”)
- **Vision**: Provide a streamlined, _Lean Startup–aligned_ platform where founders can:
  1. **Formulate** clear hypotheses about their business ideas or features.
  2. **Plan & execute** lightweight experiments to test assumptions.
  3. **Analyze results** quickly and decide whether to refine, pivot, or move forward.

### 1.2. Key Objectives

1. **Shift from Product-Focused to Hypothesis-Focused**
   - Instead of simply “validating products,” we help users break down _each assumption_ behind their idea.
2. **Simplify Experimentation**
   - Provide _predefined experiment templates_ (e.g., landing page tests, surveys, fake-door tests) for different business types—starting with B2C SaaS.
3. **Structured Build-Measure-Learn Cycle**
   - Guide users through capturing a hypothesis, setting up experiments, collecting data, and generating next steps.
4. **Minimize Time-to-Validation**
   - Emphasize quick tests that yield tangible insights without heavy dev work.

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

### 2.1. Primary Users

- **Solo Founders** or **small teams (2–3 people)**, often developers, who struggle with:
  - Validating if _anyone_ wants their idea.
  - Understanding how to test assumptions without building a fully-featured product first.

### 2.2. Initial Business Focus

- **B2C SaaS** to keep scope manageable initially.
- **Later** expansions can include directories, marketplaces, B2B, etc.

### 2.3. Use Cases

1. **Hypothesis Formulation**
   - “We believe that [audience] has [problem], so if we do [solution], they’ll [outcome].”
2. **Experiment Selection**
   - “I need a landing page test to gauge email sign-ups” or “I need a quick survey to see if the problem resonates.”
3. **Data Tracking & Analysis**
   - “We got 200 visitors and 15 sign-ups. Is that good or bad?”
4. **Decision Making**
   - “Should I pivot, refine my messaging, or double down on development?”

## 3. Key Features & Requirements

### 3.1. Hypothesis Management

**Description**: Users can create and manage multiple hypotheses, each with a clear audience, problem, solution, and benefit statement.

- **Fields**:
  - Audience
  - Problem
  - Solution
  - Benefit / Desired Outcome
  - Region (dropdown: Worldwide, North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania)
- **LLM Feedback Button (Optional)**:
  - When the user completes the hypothesis fields, they can click “Get AI Feedback” to receive short suggestions on clarity, specificity, or testability.
  - Response can appear in a modal or side panel.

**Status/States**:

- **Draft** (initial creation)
- **Active** (paired with experiments)
- **Validated** or **Invalidated** (optional, based on user self-marking results)

### 3.2. Experiment Templates & Setup

**Description**: Users see a list of recommended experiment templates for B2C SaaS validation.

- **Template Examples**:

  1. **Landing Page Smoke Test**
     - Quick instructions: “Build or mock up a landing page, track conversion (sign-ups or clicks).”
  2. **Fake Door / Feature Teaser**
     - “Add a ‘coming soon’ button or feature to gauge clicks.”
  3. **Short Survey**
     - “Send a 3–5 question survey to target users (Typeform, Google Forms, etc.).”

- **Create Experiment Flow**:

  1. User picks a template → enters basic details (experiment title, objective, success metrics).
  2. Optionally generate copy using the LLM based on the hypothesis (e.g., landing page headline).

- **Experiment Status**:
  - **Draft** → **Running** → **Completed**

### 3.3. Results Input & Analysis

**Description**: Once an experiment is completed, users can log or import basic metrics.

- **Key Metrics**:

  - Number of visitors, number of sign-ups, or number of survey responses.
  - Conversion rate auto-calculated, if applicable.
  - A notes field for qualitative findings (“People said they want feature X, not feature Y.”)

- **Optional LLM “Insights”**:
  - After user enters results, we can call an LLM with a brief prompt: “We have 200 visitors and 15 sign-ups (~7.5% conversion). Provide next-step suggestions for a B2C SaaS pre-launch scenario.”
  - Display bullet points like “Consider refining your CTA” or “Test a different audience segment.”

### 3.4. Next Steps & Recommendations

**Description**: A dedicated screen or panel with suggestions after experiment data is submitted.

- **Recommendation Types**:
  1. **Refine/Pivot**: “If conversion < 3–5%, try changing your value prop or focusing on a different segment.”
  2. **Continue/Iterate**: “If results are promising, run a second experiment to validate pricing or a second feature.”
  3. **Proceed to Build**: “If strongly validated, move on to an MVP or alpha release.”

### 3.5. User Dashboard / Home Screen

**Description**: A central view with all active hypotheses and experiments.

- **Sections**:
  1. **Hypotheses List**: Title, short summary, next steps.
  2. **Experiments**: Each experiment linked to a hypothesis, with status and summary metrics.
  3. **“Add New Hypothesis”** or “Plan Another Experiment” quick actions.

### 3.6. Additional Features (Future Enhancements)

- **Team Collaboration**: Invite cofounders or colleagues to see and collaborate on the same experiments.
- **Deeper Integrations**: Automated data pull from Typeform or Google Analytics.
- **Extensive LLM** for in-line copy generation, advanced competitor insights, or chat-based Q&A.
- **Multiple Business Models**: Specialized templates for B2B, marketplaces, etc.

## 4. Technical & Implementation Details

### 4.1. Architecture & Domain Model

1. **Entities**:

   - **User**: Basic auth, profile, etc.
   - **Hypothesis**: Tied to a user; includes audience, problem, solution, benefit, region.
   - **Experiment**: Tied to a hypothesis; includes template type, objective, success metric, status.
   - **Results**: Attached to an experiment; includes numeric data (e.g., visitors, sign-ups, etc.) and notes.

2. **Bounded Context**: _Validation Management_

   - Focus on the domain of hypothesis/experiment results within a single codebase, aligned with DDD principles.

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Optional but recommended to differentiate the product.
   - Use a simple prompt architecture:
     - “You are an expert in startup validation. The user’s hypothesis is X. Suggest up to 3 improvements.”
   - Must handle rate limiting (especially if using external APIs like OpenAI).

### 4.2. Data Model (Simplified)

- **User**
  - `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
- **Hypothesis**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `audience`, `problem`, `solution`, `benefit`, `region`, `status`, `created_at`
- **Experiment**
  - `id`, `hypothesis_id`, `template_type`, `title`, `objective`, `metric_goal`, `status`, `created_at`
- **Results** (or store fields directly on Experiment if only one set of results)
  - `id`, `experiment_id`, `visitors_count`, `signups_count`, `notes`, `conversion_rate`, `created_at`

### 4.3. Frontend & UI

- **Framework**: React, Next.js, or similar.
- **Screens (Minimum)**:
  1. **Dashboard / Home**
  2. **Hypothesis Form** (Create / Edit)
  3. **Experiment Templates** (Selection)
  4. **Experiment Setup** (Customizing template)
  5. **Results Entry / Analysis**
  6. **Next Steps / Recommendations**

### 4.4. Timeline & MVP Scope

- **Phase 1 (2–4 Weeks)**:

  - Implement Hypothesis creation & storage.
  - Implement Experiment creation from templates.
  - Provide a single-screen Results entry & basic auto-conversion calculation.
  - Optional LLM: simple prompt for initial hypothesis feedback.

- **Phase 2**:
  - Add “Next Steps / Recommendations” logic.
  - Add more advanced LLM features.
  - Integrate user feedback & refine UI/UX.

## 5. User Flow Recap

1. **User logs in** → lands on **Dashboard**.
2. **Creates a Hypothesis** (specifying audience, problem, solution, benefit, region).
3. **Clicks “Get AI Feedback”** (optional) → sees short suggestions to clarify.
4. **Selects Experiment Template** → configures details (goal, success metric).
5. **Executes experiment** externally (landing page, survey, etc.).
6. **Enters Results** → sees conversion rates or other data.
7. **“Next Steps”** → LLM or rule-based suggestions (pivot, iterate, or proceed).

---

## 6. Examples & Demo Content

To make the platform more tangible, the dashboard can list _example user problems/hypotheses_:

- “_Habit Tracker Gamification_” (creator: StickyNotesDev)
- “_Freelance Collaboration SaaS_” (creator: RemoteGang)

Each example might show:

1. **Hypothesis**
   - “Remote freelancers want to form quick teams.”
2. **Experiment**
   - “Landing page: measure sign-ups.”
3. **Results**
   - “150 visitors, 10 sign-ups = ~6.6% conversion”
4. **Next Step**
   - “Tweak copy or pivot audience.”

---

## 7. Risks & Considerations

1. **LLM Cost & Reliability**
   - Ensure usage limits and fallbacks if the LLM is unreachable or too expensive.
2. **User Adoption**
   - The platform might initially attract only a niche group (founder-developers). Plan to gather feedback quickly and adjust.
3. **Feature Creep**
   - Keep the MVP tight. Don’t expand to multiple business models until you validate user demand.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

1. **User Engagement**:
   - At least X number of founders create a hypothesis and run at least one experiment.
2. **Feedback Quality**:
   - Positive user reports that the platform clarified their idea and saved them time.
3. **MVP Iteration**:
   - Incorporate user suggestions in subsequent releases to refine or add crucial features.
