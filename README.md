# Hey there, future founder! ðŸ‘‹

Ever wished you had a co-founder to bounce ideas off of? That's exactly why we built CheckMVP - your free AI-powered companion that helps validate your startup ideas.

## Why We Built This

As founders ourselves, we know how lonely and overwhelming the early stages can be. You've got this amazing idea, but:

- Is anyone actually going to use it?
- Are you solving a real problem?
- Where do you even start with market research?

We've been there. That's why we created CheckMVP - to give you the clarity and confidence you need to move forward (or pivot early if needed).

## How We Help You

Think of CheckMVP as your unofficial co-founder who's available 24/7 to:

- Challenge your assumptions (in a good way!)
- Help you understand if people actually need your solution
- Show you what your potential competitors are doing right (and wrong)
- Point out opportunities you might have missed
- Give you honest feedback about your idea's strengths and weaknesses

## Getting Started Is Super Simple

1. Tell us about your idea (don't worry, it doesn't have to be perfect)
2. Get detailed insights about your target market, potential users, and opportunities
3. Download a comprehensive report to guide your next steps

## Completely Free & Open Source

Yes, you read that right! CheckMVP is:

- 100% free to use
- Open source (check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gruz0/checkmvp))
- Built by founders, for founders
