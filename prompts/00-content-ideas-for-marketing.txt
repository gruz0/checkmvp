- Friendly Tone: Use a conversational tone, as if you're chatting with a friend.
- Avoid Jargon: Skip formal, sales-like language or buzzwords such as "streamline," "enhance," "tailored," "leverage," "thrilled," etc.
- Ensure the language is clear, practical, and builds confidence in the product's value.
- Highlight the customer product's unique benefits for each strategy and assist in understanding market demand.
